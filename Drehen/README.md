# Drehen

> The first poster in the series is based on the use of grid systems and rendering an artwork withing that scaffolding. The illustration echoes the repetitive and geometric nature of patterns, something seen commonly in Swiss Typography Style.



### Method
---
 - Illustrate a grid of squares with a nested for loop.
 - While generating each  square, translate the origin of the grid to the center of the square (we are plotting the square in center mode).
 - A flag (counter) is defined that helps us to rotate each square with a multiple of 36 degreees (36, 72, 108 and so on).
 - The color is intended to change at with each iteration of the nested for loop. The R,G,B values are preset with certain values and are incremented/decremented at different rates to paint the artwork with the depicted gradient.
 - The text is positioned in the same way as the squares, by offsetting the origin to the desired location.
 - Being Swiss typography posters, I chose the font 'Helvetica' for rendering my series title, and subtext here (basic font operations used here can be looked up in processing help.)
 - Key Pressed function is used to save the frame as an artwork when finally done.

### Reference
---
 - [Processing Help Reference](https://processing.org/reference).
   I looked up the reference to understand some of the used concepts like push, pop for interacting with the co-ordinate system, font classes and functions etc.
